# javascript-dci

A small library to facilitate using the DCI (Data Context Interaction) pattern in javascript.

## DCI (Data Context Interaction)

From wikipedia:

> Data, context and interaction (DCI) is a paradigm used in computer software to program systems of communicating objects. Its goals are:
> + To improve the readability of object-oriented code by giving system behavior first-class status;
> + To cleanly separate code for rapidly changing system behavior (what the system does) from code for slowly changing domain knowledge (what the system is), instead of combining both in one class interface;
> + To help software developers reason about system-level state and behavior instead of only object state and behavior;
> + To support an object style of thinking that is close to peoples' mental models, rather than the class style of thinking that overshadowed object thinking early in the history of object-oriented programming languages.
